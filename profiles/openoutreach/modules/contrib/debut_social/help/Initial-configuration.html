<h2>Service Links</h2>

<ul>
<li>Under Administer/Site configuration, choose Service Links.</li>
<li>Under "general settings" select for which content types you would like to add share buttons. </li>
<li>The rest of the configuration does not require changes unless you wish different settings.</li>
<li>Save your configurations.</li>
<li>Next, under the "services" tab, select the providers you wish to have show as buttons.</li>
<li>Include "Forward" to enable emailing to a friend.</li>
<li>Rearrange to the order you would like.</li>
<li>Save your configurations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>CAPTCHA</h2>

<ul>
<li>If you are using Forward to enable emailing, then be sure to download and enable CAPTCHA (http://drupal.org/project/captcha).</li>
<li>Configure CAPTCHA under Administer/ User management.</li>
<li>Check the box "Add CAPTCHA administration links to forms."</li>
<li>Next test generate a form of the type you want to add a CAPTCHA to, in this case email.  Click the box where it notes no CAPTCHA enabled and do so.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Follow</h2>

<ul>
<li>Under Administer/Site building, select "site follow links".</li>
<li>Insert the URL for any service you want to show, "follow us on".</li>

<li>If you want to change any of the configuration of "site follow" and "user follow" blocks do so via Administer/Site building/Blocks.  For each block, you can select "Configure" and here choose the display, for example "Follow us" vs. "Follow site name".</li>
