 - /admin/modules

2. Grant permission to use this module from "People > Permissions"
 - /admin/people/permissions#module-comment_notify

 - /admin/structure/types/manage/[your_content_type] 
 - e.g. /admin/structure/types/manage/page

  -Determine which content types to activate it for
  -Determine which subscription modes are allowed
  -Configure the templates for the e-mails
  
6. Set your node-notify settings per user (optional)

The module includes a feature to notify the node author of all comments on 
their nodes. To enable this go to "My account" > Edit (e.g. user/1/edit)
and change the settings there, i.e., "Comment follow-up notification settings"

TEMPLATE TRANSLATION
--------------------

Notification templates are passed through t() before being added to the
email's body. Therefore, for you to translate them to other languates you
need to:

1. Enable the Locale module.

2. Choose a node in which you are not the auther and has comments and comment
on it. This will send an email to the author and other commenters.

3. Open the Translation Interface, located at
   admin/config/regional/translate/translate

4. Search for the template strings and add the translations.

OPTIONAL MODULES
----------------

Performance: If you notice that your site is very slow when submitting
new comments it is possible that the problem is with sending the mails. 
One option is to use the Queue Mail module
http://drupal.org/project/queue_mail

COMPATIBILITY NOTE
------------------

Comment Notify is not built to work on sites where other notification related 
modules are installed (modules like Actions, Notify, Subscriptions, and 
Organic Groups are popular examples). If you install both Comment Notify and
one of these other mail modules on your site in addition to Comment Notify
it may send duplicate messages and/or have user interface elements that will
appear to be duplicates and confuse your site visitors.

The suggested configuration in these instances is to separate Comment Notify and
whatever other mail module you have installed. Common ways to separate them are
by content type or user permissions.
