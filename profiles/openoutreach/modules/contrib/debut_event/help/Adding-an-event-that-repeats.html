<p>To create an event that repeats:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start by inputting the date and time for the first occurrence of the event.  You may also add in an end date and time as well.</li>
<li>Under the repeat section you have both a "Frequency" and a "Period" to choose from.  You would choose "Every" under "Frequency" and "Weeks" under "Period" to have an event that repeats weekly.</li>
<li>Next, you must enter the date the events repeats until.  It is easiest to select the date of the last day of your repeating event and a time that is after the end time.</li>
</ul>
<p>Advanced options:</p>
<ul>
<li>To create more advanced options, add in selections from the advanced menu.</li>
<li>For example, if you want a meeting that is the first Tuesday of every month, start by filling in the information as you would for any repeating event. (in this case, "Every" under "Frequency" and  "Month" under "Period".)</li>
<li> Under the advanced section, under "Day of  Week", select "First Tuesday".</li>
</ul>
<p>Exceptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can also select dates to omit under "Except".  So if an event is not happening on a particular date that falls within the repeat rules, add in that date to omit.</li>
<li>If you need to omit more than one date, put in the first date to omit.  Save your settings and then go back in to edit and you will have another date box to fill in.</li>
</ul>
