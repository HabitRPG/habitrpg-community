<ul>
<li>Begin by entering the title of your event.</li>
<li>The From (start date) is the next required field.  A pop-up calendar will appear or use the format: month/day/year, e.g., 08/31/2010</li>
<li>You may add in an optional start time for your event.  Use the format: 09:42PM, using the tab button to move from hour to minutes and AM/PM</li>
<li>Your event may also include an optional end date and time. End times are important for the calendar view.</li>
<li>The Event description text can be typed directly into the description section or pasted as plain text from a text editor or word processing program (formatting will be lost.)</li>
<li>The button below the description section which should be set for "Filtered HTLM" has an adjacent "Formating help" link that lists which HTML tags will be allowed for you to format your text.  Or if you have the WYSIWYG feature enabled you will have a text editor for easily formatting your selection.</li>
<li>For most Event posts, you will not need to adjust other settings, and can now preview and save (or just save).</li>
<li>If you would like to change any settings, you can do so via menu settings, authoring information, etc., prior to saving.</li>
</ul>
