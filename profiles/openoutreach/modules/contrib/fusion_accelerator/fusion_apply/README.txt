-- SUMMARY --

Fusion Apply is used for modular styling on blocks, views, menus, pages and regions.  It 
bridges the open-ended power of CSS with a controlled administration, so Drupal
themers can provide safe, point-and-click styling to their projects.  


-- HISTORY --

At the base of Fusion Apply is a fork of Skinr, which was maintained by:

* Jacine Luisi (Jacine) - http://drupal.org/user/88931
* Balarama Bosch (moonray) - http://drupal.org/user/68275
* Gravitek Labs - http://www.graviteklabs.com

.. with contributions from many other members of the community.  

Fusion has strongly encouraged and promoted Skinr as a sustainable approach to 
Drupal front end development.  As our need for Skinr outgrew our ability to help 
Skinr 7.x move forward along its development path, we decided to take the project under 
our own wing to have the necessary freedom needed to build high quality Drupal 7 themes.
Fusion 7 relies on Skinr, but a year after the Drupal release, Skinr was still not available
as a stable release.  Fusion Apply provides an immediate solution, but it also lets us 
take the module in exciting new directions in the future.


-- REQUIREMENTS --

* This module will work out-of-the-box with Fusion themes.  To use Skinr with a non-Fusion
  theme, it needs to define skins.


-- INSTALLATION --

* Enable the module.  See http://drupal.org/node/70151 for further information on how
  to enable modules.
