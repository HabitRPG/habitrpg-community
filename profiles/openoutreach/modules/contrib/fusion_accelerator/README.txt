-- SUMMARY --

Fusion Accelerator is a group of modules that create a helpful toolset for easy theming of Drupal sites. Originally designed for the Fusion theme (http://www.drupal.org/project/fusion) and its sub-themes, Accelerator will also provide extra functionality for many themes.

-- THE MODULES --

* Fusion Apply - Provides tools for applying skins to your site.
* Fusion Apply Rules - Provides tools for creating rules for skin application on regions and pages.
* Fusion Apply UI - The point and click interface for using your skins. 
* Fusion Grid Tools - Provides a group of utilities to create custom grids with the Fusion theme.


-- REQUIREMENTS --

This module has no dependencies, though having Fusion installed will give the most use out of the tools.

-- INSTALLATION -- 

Enable the modules you wish to use - Fusion Apply and Fusion Apply UI are the most likely candidates for general use. See http://drupal.org/node/70151 for further information on how to enable modules.
