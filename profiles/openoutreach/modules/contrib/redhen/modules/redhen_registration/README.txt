# RedHen Registration

## Description

The RedHen Registration module provides an optional integration between RedHen
and the [Entity Registration][1] module. When enabled, the RedHen Registration
module adds an additional tab to the Contact Entity screen called
"Registrations." There, both authenticated and anonymous event registrations
will be listed for each Contact, based upon a matching email address.

Note: In the future, we plan on extending this module such that new
registrations associated with email addresses **not** found in RedHen CRM will
trigger the creation of new Contact entities.
