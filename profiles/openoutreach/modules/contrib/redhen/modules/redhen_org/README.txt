# RedHen Organization

## Description

* The RedHen Organization module defines an entity type called "Organization."
* To create/manage organization entities, go to: Structure > RedHen CRM > Organization Types (http://yoursite.com/admin/structure/redhen/org_types).
* To add a new organization, go to: RedHen > Add Organization (http://yoursite.com/redhen/org/add).
* Finally, if a organization entity is no longer applicable in your CRM solution, you have the option to either delete, or simply "archive" that organization record. Archiving an organization entity is similar to blocking a Drupal user account, in that it does not permanently delete the record, but it does prevent the entity from being used or viewed in reports.
