# RedHen Fields

## Description

This module defines fields specific to RedHen CRM. At the time of this writing, this module provides an email field for managing multiple email addresses for a contact or an organization. In addition to allowing you to record multiple addresses, you can set a primary address - as well as manage email receipt preferences per address.

Note: The RedHen Contact module depends upon the RedHen Fields module, and adds an address field to contact entity bundles on install.
