# RedHen Relation

## Description

The RedHen Relation module allows you to manage connections between Contacts, as
well as between Contacts and Organizations. "Connections" are represented by
fieldable entity bundles. As such, you can create different types of connections.
Using fields, these different types of connections can have their own "metadata."
For example, you could create a "employer" relation bundle that includes a
"job title" field.

To manage default and add new RedHen Relation bundles, go to: Structure >
Relation Types. Then, to add relations between contacts as well as between
contacts and organizations, go the "Connections" tab on a Contact or
Organization tab.

## Organization Connections - Setting an "Organizational Role" and Primary Contact

The connections between Contacts and Organizations provide two additional
options. First, you can assign one or more Contacts as "admins" for the
Organization. At the time of this writing, assigning admins does not provide any
additional functionality. However, in the short term, we intend for this role to
manage user access to editing/viewing organization data. Second, you can assign
a single Contact as the "primary" contact for the organization. To assign a
primary contact, go to the "Connections" UI for an Organization. In the list of
associated Contacts, click "Set as primary."
