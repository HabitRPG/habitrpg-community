# RedHen Contact

## Description

* The RedHen Contact module defines an entity type called "Contact."
* To create/manage contact entities, go to: Structure > RedHen CRM > Contact Types (http://yoursite.com/admin/structure/redhen/contact_types).
* All contact bundles include a property called "Contact name" and a RedHen email field.
* To add a new contact, go to: RedHen > Add Contact (http://yoursite.com/redhen/contact/add).
* When viewing a contact entity, you can optionally associate that contact entity with a Drupal user account. To do so, first make sure that you have configured RedHen to connect Contacts and Users at: Configuration > RedHen CRM (http://yoursite.com/admin/config/redhen). Then, when viewing a Contact entity, click the "Drupal User" tab, and either select an existing Drupal account or create a new one.
* Finally, if a contact entity is no longer applicable in your CRM solution, you have the option to either delete, or simply "archive" that contact record. Archiving a contact entity is similar to blocking a Drupal user account, in that it does not permanently delete the record, but it does prevent the entity from being used or viewed in reports.
